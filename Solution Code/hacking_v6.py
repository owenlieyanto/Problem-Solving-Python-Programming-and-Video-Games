# Hacking Version 6
# This is a graphical password guessing game that displays a
# list of potential computer passwords. The player is allowed
# up to 4 attempts to guess the password. Each time the user
# guesses incorrectly, the user is prompted to make a new guess.
# The game indicates whether the player successfully guessed
# the password or not.
